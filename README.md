📊 Health Plan Benefits, Cost Sharing & Network Analysis
🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes health insurance plans by combining information on benefits, cost-sharing structures, and provider networks.
The goal is to understand how plan design elements interact and how they may impact accessibility, affordability, and value for beneficiaries.

A merged dataset was created to enable a unified analysis across these dimensions.

🎯 Objectives

- Analyze benefit structures offered by health plans

- Examine cost-sharing mechanisms (deductibles, copays, coinsurance)

- Explore provider network characteristics

- Merge benefits & network data to uncover meaningful patterns

- Improve data readability for policy, business, or academic insights

📂 Data Description

The analysis is based on multiple datasets:

- Benefits dataset: covered services and plan features

- Cost-sharing dataset: out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries

- Network dataset: provider availability and network characteristics

These datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged to allow cross-analysis.

⚠️ Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full merged dataset is not included.
A representative sample is provided for reproducibility.

🛠 Methodology

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Standardization of identifiers across datasets

- Merging benefits, cost-sharing, and network data

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Visualization and interpretation of key patterns

- The full workflow is documented step-by-step in the Jupyter notebook.

📈 Key Insights (Summary)

- Significant variation exists in cost-sharing levels across plans

- Certain benefit structures are associated with higher out-of-pocket costs

- Provider network size and structure may influence plan accessibility

- Merging benefits and network data enables deeper, more actionable insights

🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

📊 Power BI Dashboard

This project includes an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing:

- Health plan benefits based on each metal level ( platinium , gold, silver, bronze, catastrophic)
- the distibution of metal levels accross the majority of US states
- Prediction of the last final price for each patient based on the level metal, the state , and on the category of age he's ore she's under it ,either the young or the old category.
